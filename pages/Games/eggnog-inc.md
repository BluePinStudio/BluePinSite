Eggnog Incorporated was our first steam game. It was made using the Construct 3 game engine over the course of a few months. Development started in October 2020 and wrapped up in January 2021.
In this game, you play as an eggnog inspector. You are tasked with finding inconsistencies and errors with the packaging, ingredients, color, and many other elements. All the while, a whacky, and perhaps, unethical CEO gives you increasingly suspicious requests after work hours. Your actions affect your work environment, and can even cause you to find a different job or doom the world.
There are many endings and many different office layouts to explore.
