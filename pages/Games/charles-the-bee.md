Charles, the Bee is our fourth steam game. It is being made using the Construct 3 game engine. This game was initially made for the Ludum Dare 52 Game Jam in January 2023. Set to be fully released sometime in 2023.

In this game, you play as Charles. Charles has been longing for a chance in the dancing spotlight. Your goal will be to collect pollen which pays the entrance fees of various clubs to showcase your dancing prowess. You will be faced with challenging opponents and all sorts of other chaotic elements on your journey to, one day, getting the dance master crown.
