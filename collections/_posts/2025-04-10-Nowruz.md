## Welcome!
Welcome to the 8th monthly recap blog post. I always intended to keep going indefinitely but I find myself pleased that the plan is still going strong nonetheless!

## March 2025 Goals 
  - [x] Go to two game dev meetups, Bonus Stage Toronto and Dirty Rectangles Toronto
  - [ ] Get Explory Story to a state where it's playable from start to finish including cutscenes.
  - [x] Put up 50 more Pixel Fixel stickers!
  - [ ] Make a special video for the 5 year Blue Pin Studio Anniversary! (March 29th)

  Oof! That's the worst completion percentage yet! Regarding the Anniversary video, I was half way through recording game footage for some of my older games when I decided to abandon the video. Since the anniversary of the studio is so close to New Years, in the future I'll just fold in celebrating the year then.

## Bonus Tasks Completed in March 2025
  - [x] Posted Falling Thingies to Newgrounds
  - [x] Wrote a blog post mortem post for Falling Thingies

## April 2025 Goals 
  - [ ] Go to two game dev meetups, Bonus Stage Toronto and Dirty Rectangles Toronto
  - [ ] Submit a game to Ludum Dare 57
  - [ ] Update Trash Force with "THE HUB" Milestone
  - [ ] Publish Pixel Fixel Anniversary update
  - [ ] Host Final Pixel Fixel Tournament!
  - [ ] Publish Charles the Bee multiplayer update
  - [ ] File taxes
  - [ ] Get Explory Story to a state where it's playable from start to finish including cutscenes.

  Have a bit to catch up on Explory Story, a tale as old as time, and the rest is pretty standard game dev progress! The pixel fixel anniversary update will likely be the last time I add any feature to the game, it will represent the final version of the game. That excites me because it has occupied my thoughts a lot over the last 12 months. It will be nice to move on mentally and reclaim some of the brain-space!

## Footer & Note to Future Self
Last month's blog post said the future is looking bright and I couldn't agree more. For the first time in a long time I'm excited about the projects I have cooking and the people on those projects. I'm privileged to work with such hard working, kind and passionate developers. I find myself grateful for my network of peers and friends too, they've all been massively helpful.

As is tradition, here's the song that stood out to me over the last few weeks! Cheers everyone, see you next month!
