|Somewhere ages and ages hence
|Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
|I took the one less traveled by,
|And that has made all the difference.

## Welcome!

First month of the year down! Month 70 in the Blue Pin Studio game development arch...

## January 2026 Goals

- [ ] Eggnog Incorporated Overhaul Update
- [ ] Falling Thingies steam-ready build
- [x] Trash Force milestone planning for 2026
- [x] 2025 yearly recap post [read it here!](/blog/2026-01-30-2025-Yearly-Recap/)

What an elusive Eggnog update amirite?! I might have to move it aside to free up brain space. I didn't get it ready in time for the holidays so we'll have to circle back for next years holiday season.

On the bright side, the Falling Thingies project is almost entirely done! We should be able to do a launch late Feb or early March. Starting off the year with a game launch is perfect medicine for the soul (and hopefully a little bit of medicine for the wallet too).


## Bonus Tasks Completed in December 2025

- [x] Hosted the 2026 Construct 3 game jam!

It was my third year in a row doing the Construct 3 game jam! This year we had more prizes than ever thanks to generous sponsors. People who have know me well can see the influence I had over the theme of the jam haha

I had a blast finally seeing a jam with the chicken theme. Getting to play 30+ chicken games was a blast. It was a cool experience and I'm proud of being able to do it for the third year in a row.

## February 2026 Goals

- [ ] Trash Force incremental demo (in the new resolution)
- [ ] Falling Thingies new demo and full back to front feature complete

Time to focus! Fewer tasks, big tasks, no distractions. In March we'll resume going to meetups and April we'll do a game jam. Even this post is short and rushed, NO TIME!



## Musings
Who has time for musings?! Im writing this 1hr before I have to run off to do day job stuff. I have to focus on releasing Falling Thingies, preparing Trash Force and most importantly trying to make more money in my day job. Go go go!

As is customary here's a banger I've been listening to lately.
