## Introduction

During the [Ludum Dare 57](https://ldjam.com/) game jam, we created **Antz vs Plantz**. The theme was **Depth**, and we had 3 days complete the game. The team consisted of Myself (Viktor),Manisha and Keely.

## Reception

**Final Game**: We had 50 users try it out and leave lots of comments as well. There was even a scoreboard built into Alakajam where a handful of users competed on high scores! It was awesome to see people climb to such high scores and saying such nice things about the game. I was worried that my entry where its mostly me making the graphics wouldn't be received well, but it turned out great. Lots of people showed love for how the game looked and played.
