## Introduction

During the [Ludum Dare 57](https://ldjam.com/) game jam, we created **Antz vs Plantz**. The theme was **Depth**, and we had 3 days complete the game. The team consisted of Myself (Viktor), Manisha and Keely. This is the same team responsible for bringing you the infamous [RAMpage](https://bluepinstudio.itch.io/rampage). Keely and Manisha are both gamedevs who live in Toronto, Canada area. 

This allows us to meet up in person to collaborate which is a treat! All three of us are working on our own Steam games (links below) so this was a perfect opportunity to distract ourselves and inject some fresh air into what can sometimes be a very long process.


## Timeline

### Pre-Jam
Normally I like to prepare for Ludum Dare by creating a document allowing the team to brainstorm using the potential theme options. This time we didn't do any pre-production. For shame!

### Jam Begins...
As soon as the jam started we got into a voice call. It was night time and most of the time was spent doodling on a shared canvas via Discord Activities. Something that is noteworthy to point out is that the idea we ended up choosing in the end was a plinko/tower defense hybrid. The noteworthy aspect of this is Manisha's reaction to the idea which you can see in this screenshot before i crossed it out. She said "nahhh"

Luckily Manisha pivoted quickly and decided to give the idea a shot! That means we were a few hours into the jam and we already had the game design planned. This is crucial for a weekend game jam. We had the benefit of having three full days of actual production...

### The Development
The idea we settled on the night before was a game where you place towers on pachinko-style pegs as ants fall down. If an ant gets to the bottom, you lose some health. If a lot of ants get to the bottom, you lose entirely.

Our development was smooth and steady! We met up the subsequent morning on Saturday at a coffee shop and worked on the game. Part of the process involved a detour where we gobbled up some of Toronto's finest momos. Shoutout to Loga's! 

Here is what an early build of the game looked like. The process was basically establishing what type of towers we wanted on the pegs and what types of ants we wanted.

Additionally we spent a bunch of time adding fun decoration to the level such as these two tree mascots. One is nice and helpful, the other one isn't nice or helpful. This is what the game looked like after Day 1 of production was completed!

Day 2 and Day 2.5 (since Ludum Dare ends at 6pm on Monday) was spent adding new ant types, adding plantz, etc etc. A lot of busy work going back and forth on assets, sounds, music, and iterating as much as possible. This was all done remotely, so no dumplings for us :(

We published the game at the last minute and it was relatively bug free! Another solid 3 day development completed.

## Reception

**Final Game**: We had 90 Ludum Dare participants try it out and leave lots of comments as well. Additionally, we logged 224 scores logged to the database. It's unclear how many unique players we got because we don't have any identifiable data, but it seems like somewhere around 200! A fantastic outcome.

In addition to lots of people leaving lovely comments and playing the game, we got great scores once the Ludum Dare 57 results were announced. This is one of my most successful game jams, and even moreso if you look at my Ludum Dare submissions exclusively. I'm very pleased with the outcome and I'm very excited to see how it plays out on Newgrounds. 

Maybe even one day, we will have the opportunity to "make it into a full game." The game jam cliche haha.
