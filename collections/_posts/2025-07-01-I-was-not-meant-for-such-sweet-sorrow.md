## Musings
A hectic month because it involved being sick for a solid week, then falling behind on my work stuff. It all got sorted out eventually and we're back to firing on all cylinders! ðŸ’› At some point I had the wind knocked out of my sails in regards to the lack of success after 63 months of trying, but I think we're closer than ever so I'm not too stuck on that.
