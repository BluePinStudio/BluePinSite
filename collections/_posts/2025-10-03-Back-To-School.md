## Welcome!
Yo. We've hit a new record. Fewest goals completed. Oops.


## September 2025 Goals 
  - [ ] Publish one longform youtube video 
  - [ ] Polish Falling Thingies 
  - [ ] New Trash Force Content (Boss and Act2)
  - [ ] Charles Anniversary update

Oh boy! It was a relatively small list of things I had to get done but even still, didn't get any of them done. Lately I've been going to the gym every day and when that collides with a busy day-job schedule, the gamedev stuff gets slightly brushed to the side. 

Also the release of a sequel to one of my favorite games came out, which didn't help the productivity. I guess we can consider it an impromptu "rest month" and move on! :)

## Bonus Tasks Completed in Semptember 2025
  - [x] Streamed random things on the Blue Pin Studio twitch account (9hrs)
  - [x] Ship Happens ([post mortem here](/blog/2025-08-25-Ship-Happens-Post-Mortem/)) ended up on the Newgrounds front page!
  - [x] Address tariffs & shipping for the Etsy store
  - [x] Attend 2 gamedev meetups

Completly unplanned, mostly owed to Evan from RetroMMO telling me "go live," I started streaming some gamedev and gaming on the Blue Pin Studio twitch account. That account hasn't streamed anything since 2021 when me and Will were working on our older games and the 'dream project.' I don't know how much I will stream in the future but it's relatively easy to turn on the stream while doing work or gaming. Perhaps 10hrs per month is a decent amount, we'll see! I don't want to make a formal goal because its entirely recreational.

I'm not sure why the gamedev meetups weren't included in the main tasks for the month, that's something I want to keep doing indefinitely. I love meeting new people and hearing about what everyone is up to.


## October 2025 Goals 
  - [ ] Submit a game for Ludum Dare 57
  - [ ] Make post mortem for the Ludum Dare submission
  - [ ] Charles Anniversary update
  - [ ] Polish Falling Thingies 
  - [ ] New Trash Force Content (Boss and Act2)
  - [ ] Publish two longform youtube videos
  - [ ] Attend 2 gamedev meetups

Quite a long list, huh? Let's see how we fair. My day job isn't getting less busy, so it will certainly be a challenge to fit all of this and the other secret stuff in. God speed!

## Musings
For me personally, like i mentioned above, I've been going to the gym every day for months now and it's not really getting easier. I'm down 20 pounds (225lbs -> 205lbs) from when i started 5ish months ago, so progress is great. Eventually I want to return to running like i used to as a young adult. I did the 2015 half marathon in October and i've been looking forward to 'probably' doing either a half or full marathon in October 2026. We'll see! 

At the moment the name of the game is personal development and enriching my friendships and personal life. Here's another fantastic song, as is customary at the end of the blog posts. See y'all in a month!
