## Welcome!
Here we are again! Thanks for joining me on the 61th month of this indie adventure :D 

## April 2025 Goals 
  - [x] Go to two game dev meetups, Bonus Stage Toronto and Dirty Rectangles Toronto
  - [x] Submit a game to Ludum Dare 57
  - [x] Update Trash Force with "THE HUB" Milestone
  - [x] Publish Pixel Fixel Anniversary update
  - [ ] Host Final Pixel Fixel Tournament!
  - [ ] Publish Charles the Bee multiplayer update
  - [x] File taxes
  - [ ] Get Explory Story to a state where it's playable from start to finish including cutscenes.

  Pretty solid month, most goals were met. I accidentally forgot about the Pixel Fixel tournament again. I guess the lesson is, anything that isn't in my calendar has a high chance to slip my mind haha.
 

## Bonus Tasks Completed in April 2025
  - [x] Prepare Steam page and commission artist for Falling Thingies

  Like I mentioned in the [post mortem for Falling Thingies](/blog/2025-03-15-Falling-Thingies-Post-Mortem/#:~:text=Based%20on%20the,keep%20you%20posted!) the game will be seeing the spotlight! A steam release and a mobile release! Very exciting...

## May 2025 Goals 
  - [ ] Write a blog post mortem post for Antz vs Plantz
  - [ ] Update & Deploy Antz vs Plantz to Newgrounds
  - [ ] Publish Charles the Bee multiplayer update
  - [ ] Host Final Pixel Fixel Tournament!
  - [ ] Make Falling Thingies Steam page public
  - [ ] Trash Force "Graystone Milestone"
  - [ ] Celebrate Birthday!
  - [ ] Explory Story Act 1 Boulder re-work

  May is going to be a fantastic month! We'll get to see how well Newgrounds users enjoy Antz vs Plantz, we'll finally wrap up Pixel Fixel tournaments, and we'll deploy the Falling Thingies Steam Page publically. Those are all going to be moments that boost morale quite a lot. It's important to have frequent morale boosts on endeavors like this one. Making video games and trying to make a living off of that is difficult. It's slightly less difficult when you have people enjoying and leaving comments about your games.

## Footer & Note to Future Self
The month was relatively uneventful on the person side, so the note to future self is not going to have any juice in it. This recent Ludum Dare was a great success and I'm excited to release Falling Thingies, Trash Force, and Explory Story soon!

As is tradition, here's the song that stood out to me over the last few weeks! Cheers everyone, see you next month!
