## Welcome!

Ho Ho Ho! December has come and gone! Let's see what ol' vik was up to! Happy New Year by the way :)

## December 2025 Goals

- [ ] Eggnog Incorporated Overhaul Update (due by Dec 17)
- [x] Falling Thingies incremental slight pivot
- [ ] Prepare "5 years ago I made this game" video for publishing Jan 1
- [x] Take it easy pal, relaaaax

I think I took the "take it easy pal" task a little bit too seriously haha. The eggnog update got roughly 70% done but then i devolved into simply playing games to soothe the mind. I'm going to put the eggnog update in January 2026's goals, it should be relatively easy to get it out in the first week or so of January. Look forward to that!

Regarding YouTube? Man... I've put that task on my to-do many months now. Perhaps I just don't have enough time to do it. I'll reconsider doing YouTube content once Falling Thingies is released...


## Bonus Tasks Completed in December 2025

- [x] 16hrs of [Twitch Streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/bluepinstudio)
- [x] Updated my suite of gamedev tools (beta) [test em out here, at your own risk!](/tools/)
- [x] Created a new Steam bundle with some new developer friends! [The Corporate Climb Bundle](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/65464/The_Corporate_Climb/)

## January 2026 Goals

- [ ] Eggnog Incorporated Overhaul Update
- [ ] Falling Thingies steam-ready build
- [ ] Trash Force milestone planning for 2026
- [ ] 2025 yearly recap post


Look at that! Only four  tasks. How hard could it be? Don't mind that one of them is literally making a game :P Place your bets if ol' Vik will be able to do 4 simple tasks in an entire month.

## Musings
A much deserved restful December has come and gone... I think I spent more time playing games this month than any other month in the last 2 years. It was a great time! 

I have so many plans for 2026 so unfortunately we're going to need to pick up the pace in January. See y'all in the 2025 yearly recap to learn more about those plans. I suspect 2026 will be the biggest year for Blue Pin Studio yet! 

As is customary here's a banger I've been listening to lately.
