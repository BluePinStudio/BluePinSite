## Welcome!

Welcome to the summary of what I was up to (and not up to apparently) during October 2025!

## November 2025 Goals

- [x] One long-form YouTube videos (November 24th?)
- [x] Pixel Fixel update
- [x] Charles the Bee Multiplayer Update
- [x] Visit 2 in-person gamedev meetups
- [x] Submit a game to [Alakajam 22](https://alakajam.com/)
- [x] Write a post-mortem blog post for Alakajam submission
- [x] Take it easy pal, relaaaax


Oof! Not a lot of goals met this time around. I had a lot of stuff pop up IRL with my day job so gamedev took a bit of a backburner in October. I did manage to get a lot of work done on the Charles update and Pixel Fixel polish. Unfortunately not enough to deploy the update to Charles but I'm very close. Probably within 24hrs of writing this blog post the update will be out!


## Bonus Tasks Completed in November 2025

- [x] Visit the [Toronto Game Expo](https://www.torontogameexpo.ca/)
- [x] 35hrs of [Twitch Streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/bluepinstudio)
- [x] Tools!

On the bright side, I visited Montreal for the first time in my life! It was a quick bus ride down so it wasn't too expensive. Who knew you could go from Toronto to Montreal for merely $15!?

Anyway, it was a great time, I enjoyed some Montreal staples like poutine and smoked meat sandwiches, saw the sights and most importantly warded off burn out for one more month ;)


## December 2025 Goals

- [ ] One long-form YouTube videos (on the 24th again?)


Pixel Fixel?! Why is that on the list? Well apparently the medals on Newgrounds are broken and I'm too far down a rabbit hole of refactoring stuff to go back and fix just that. I want to make a new game mode for it, change the way the Remixel version was advertised and finish putting up stickers all over town. ([See what stickers im talking about here](/blog/2024-12-01-Winter-Is-Coming/)) As is customary every November I guess haha

The other tasks are pretty straight forward. Finish the update for Charles, do a quick weekend game jam, finish my youtube video and go to some meetups. Didn't scope creep the November goals too much I hope.



## Musings
That about wraps it up for October! On the professional side of my life just a game jam and some updates but on the personl side it was a welcome break and weekend getaway. I reckon October 2025 is one of my favorite months of this year so far. Cheers to many more! 

As per tradition, here's a song I listened to a bunch during the month...
