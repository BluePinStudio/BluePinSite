## Welcome!
Welcome back! First Monthly recap on the new website! This website is a major upgrade in many ways. Now each game has a home alongside the blog and game jam entries. Not to mention, my growing knowledgebase in web dev allowed me to host this entirely for free! I'm saving $30/yr on hosting and I have a better site!

## January 2025 Goals 
  - [x] Host the 2025 Construct 3 game jam
  - [x] Deploy Trash Force onto Newgrounds
  - [x] Reach Minimum Viable Product with Explory Story (all the levels set up)
  - [x] Go to two game dev meetups, Bonus Stage Toronto and Dirty Rectangles Toronto
  - [x] Earn the first $1 from iOS transaction on Pixel Fixel
  - [x] Merge Blog website and main website

  Bam! First month (I think) that all the goals AND MORE were achieved! That may be more so because I decided to go easy on the goals in anticipation for a tough January, but I think it's still on-par for what I would consider a productive month. Regarding the Pixel Fixel iOS transactions, we smashed that goal out of the park! Goal was $1, we got $17! I'm officially a mobile developer haha

## Bonus Tasks Completed in January 2025
  - [x] Featured on Newgrounds front page with Trash Force
  - [x] Hosted the 7th Pixel Fixel Tournament
  - [x] Audited "Blue Pin Studio" including previous years to make a yearly recap post
  - [ ] Pitched Trash Force to a bunch of publishers

## February 2025 Goals 
  - [ ] Submit a game for BIGMODE Jam 2025
  - [ ] Submit a game for Alakajam 21
  - [ ] Go to two game dev meetups, Bonus Stage Toronto and Dirty Rectangles Toronto
  - [ ] Get Explory Story to a state where it's playable from start to finish including cutscenes.
  - [ ] Put up at least 50 more stickers for Pixel Fixel

February is not the time to lift my foot off the gas. We need more people to see Pixel Fixel, we need more games completed, we need Explory Story to get closer to complete, and so on... February is going to be a busy month!
 

## Footer & Note to Future Self
January 2025 was probably my new peak of stress. And yet? Here I am! Money problems, work problems, game problems, bah! Nothing can stop me. Shoutout to all of the people who were concerned and expressed their support. And an even bigger shoutout to two people who let me borrow some money in order to cover a spontaneous large expense. Money aside, everyone in my friend groups are the best :) 

If I ever get somewhere up high, I'll be throwing down ladders as much as I can for y'all to join me.
