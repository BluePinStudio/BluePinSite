## Introduction

During the [Do You Wanna Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/do-you-wanna-jam-2025) jam, we created **Insock Out**. The theme was **Inside Out**, and we had 9 days to complete the game. The team consisted of Myself (Viktor), Liam, Rujum, Tal, Calvin Jee.

How did I find these peeps? Placeholder

## Reception

**Final Game**: After a week of people playing the game we got our scores! We had 32 people leave ratings, and lots of comments as well. Here's a link to the scores and feedback! <https://itch.io/jam/do-you-wanna-jam-2024/rate/2884184>

Our best scores was for Art and Audio, 12th and 20th respectively. That kind of distribution is common in the jams I do, it must have something to do with my approach. I always seek to use as much of the art and music that I get sent, and perhaps catering that hard to the art and audio departments hurts the programming department. Anywho! 

**Overall, we scored 22nd out of 153 (which is top 14%), not bad at all!**
