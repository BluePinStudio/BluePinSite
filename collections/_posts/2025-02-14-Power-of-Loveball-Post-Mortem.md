## Introduction

During the [Bigmode Game Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/bigmode-game-jam-2025) game jam, we created **Power of Loveball**. The theme was **Power**, and we had 9 days comsplete the game. The team consisted of Myself (Viktor), Pijinguy, Fasla and Princess Sylvysprit.


## Timeline

### Pre-Jam


### The first half of development...

### The second half of development...


## What Went Well


- **Comment from Pijinguy (Artist + Game Design)**: every single person on the team was super talented, and delivered amazingly. so grateful for that. i finally felt my improvement in various aspects when working on this project. and the game is actually fun for me and people seem to like it. so, awesome!
- **Comment from Fasla (Artist)**:  No comment
- **Comment from Princess Sylvysprit (Soundtrack)**: The planning stages, in my opinion, tasks were dedicated clearly to everyone efficiently and quickly, and communication about when i'd be ready to start working (which was much later than the rest) did not cause any issues, i believe that was mainly thanks to my public reputation and portifolio showing my experience with composing under short time restraints, i'm glad the team trusted me with this


## Challenges


- **Comment from Pijinguy (Artist + Game Design)**: writing the dialogue was a huge challenge. this is the first time i write anything that's not for school, and i kept cringing at myself. but it turned out fine... i think. letting the first programmer leave the project due to lack of motivation was a bit worrying at first, but viktor came to the rescue fast! there was tensions in the team which does impact morale, but it did not end up imapcting the resulting product, which is what is important in such a small amount of time for dev.
- **Comment from Fasla (Artist)**: No comment
- **Comment from Princess Sylvysprit (Soundtrack)**:  Slight miscommunications about programming loop points in the music, but in my opinion it was worth it, because we were one of the few game submissions at the gamejam that actually had bothered to polish this part of the game (correct music looping), which i believe is a small but important part about making the game feel more polished and professional

## The Final Product


- **Comment from Pijinguy (Artist + Game Design)**: quite great! i knew i would enjoy this game, and i do. but i was worried others wouldn't but seemingly, early reviews are stating that the game is good, and fun. so satisfying to see. i love this game. no regrets.
- **Comment from Fasla (Artist)**: No comment
- **Comment from Princess Sylvysprit (Soundtrack)**: Honestly i think the gameplay combinations are a bit of a mess, and i saw a lot of great suggestions in the comments on the game page; for example the addition of collectible elements to unlock more dialogue in the VN segments, i think that was a missed opportunity in hindsight It was a weird game genre combination from the get go, i don't think there's much demand for a game like this if we look at the bigger picture, but it was a fun experiment for sure I also think that the flow of the platforming sections is a bit "stop and go", which i personally don't like in platformers, but changing that would require scrapping the entire main gameplay mechanic of controlling the ball with the mouse, and i think it would've been a waste to restart, so we continued with the ideas we planned out, and made the idea as polished as possible, i think that was probably our greatest strength as a team; the idea might have been kind of doomed from the start to be a bit of a mess, but i do firmly believed everyone in the team did everything to the best of their ability to deliver an overall very polished experience, i believe we've succeeded in that, it's a flawed but fun game
