## Welcome!
Ahoy everyone! Welcome back, lets get into it. We're reviewing what happened in December 2024... First, let's start off with the goals we had planned!

## December 2024 Goals 
  - [x] Participate in the Jingle Gam Jam hosted by the Yogscast
  - [x] Participate in at least one Secret Santa
  - [x] Give away 4 Charles pins
  - [ ] Get Charles the Bee to 80 reviews
  - [x] Get Pixel Fixel to 100 reviews
  - [ ] Launch the additional new Charles the Bee content
  - [x] Sign a contract with a publisher for Project Jig

Great outcome! The only bottleneck was the new Charles update. This is currently being blocked by the artist Gina. She is having a hard time with drawing due to an ongoing medical issue. Pray she recovers soon!

Everything else went smoothly and according to plan! The contract with a publisher fell through, but at least the story concluded instead of being open ended. The publisher decided not to pursue publishing the game. They were the only one we wanted to publish the game with, so the project will go into the vault until I have a better idea of what to do with it!


## Bonus Tasks Completed in December 2024
  - [x] Got featured on Apple's "Games We Love"
  - [x] Successfully hosted the 6th Pixel Fixel 1v1 Tournament
  - [x] Won the Jingle Jam! More details in [our post-mortem here!](/blog/2024-12-20-Trash-Force-Post-Mortem)
  - [x] Visited the Bonus Stage Toronto meetup to talk about games with the local game devs!

Needless to say, getting featured by Apple has a massive effect on player numbers. Check out the last few months of Pixel Fixel players!

## January 2025 Goals 
  - [ ] Host the 2025 Construct 3 game jam
  - [ ] Deploy Trash Force onto Newgrounds
  - [ ] Reach Minimum Viable Product with Explory Story (each act has all the levels set up)
  - [ ] Go to two game dev meetups, Bonus Stage Toronto and Dirty Rectangles Toronto
  - [ ] Earn the first $1 from iOS transaction on Pixel Fixel
  - [ ] Merge Blog website and main website

We're taking it easy in January. Heads down, working on games and not overdoing it. There are a few other stealth-mode things I have brewing but theres nothing worth announcing or discussing at such an early stage. 
 

## Musings
My 4~ year relationship came to an end! Nothing dramatic happened, more so the culmination of some incompatibilities. If you know me personally and you want to know more, I'm an open book, but I won't vent here publicly. Onwards and upwards!

As-is customary, I leave future self a little musical breadcrumb. This is the track I listened to most in this month, trying to hype myself up for the Yogscast jam :P
