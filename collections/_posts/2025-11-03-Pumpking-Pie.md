## Musings
For me personally, like i mentioned above, I've been going to the gym every day for months now and it's not really getting easier. I'm down 20 pounds (225lbs -> 205lbs) from when i started 5ish months ago, so progress is great. Eventually I want to return to running like i used to as a young adult. I did the 2015 half marathon in October and i've been looking forward to 'probably' doing either a half or full marathon in October 2026. We'll see! 

At the moment the name of the game is personal development and enriching my friendships and personal life. Here's another fantastic song, as is customary at the end of the blog posts. See y'all in a month!
