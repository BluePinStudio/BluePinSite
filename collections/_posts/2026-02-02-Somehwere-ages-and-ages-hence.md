|Somewhere ages and ages hence
|Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
|I took the one less traveled by,
|And that has made all the difference.

## Welcome!

First month of the year down! Month 70 in the Blue Pin Studio game development arch...

## January 2026 Goals

- [ ] Eggnog Incorporated Overhaul Update
- [x] Falling Thingies steam-ready build
- [x] Trash Force milestone planning for 2026
- [x] 2025 yearly recap post

What an elusive Eggnog update amirite?! Let's bang it out already! Jeeves, move it to the next months goal!

On the bright side, the Falling Thingies project is almost entirely done! We should be able to do a launch late Feb or early March. Starting off the year with a game launch is perfect medicine for the soul (and hopefully a little bit of medicine for the wallet too).


## Bonus Tasks Completed in December 2025

- [x] Hosted the 2026 Construct 3 game jam!

It was my third year in a row doing the Construct 3 game jam! This year we had more prizes than ever thanks to generous sponsors. People who have know me well can see the influence I had over the theme of the jam haha

It was a cool experience and I'm proud of being able to do it for the third year in a row.
