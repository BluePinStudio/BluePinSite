## Welcome!
Ahoy friend or foe. This is what I've been up to in May 2025!

## May 2025 Goals 
  - [x] Write a blog post mortem post for Antz vs Plantz
  - [x] Update & Deploy Antz vs Plantz to Newgrounds
  - [ ] Publish Charles the Bee multiplayer update
  - [ ] Host Final Pixel Fixel Tournament!
  - [x] Make Falling Thingies Steam page public
  - [ ] Trash Force "Graystone Milestone"

  As far as gamedev productivity goes, it was one of my slowest months. However still lots of forward progress on a few things and half the goals achieved! [The Falling Thingies steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3625530/Falling_Thingies/) is up, you can see an early version of it! It will be improving as time goes on.

## Musings
Was it a joyous month? At times! Was it a sad month? At times! I guess this is how things are for most people right? Just as a reminder to my future self, at the moment I have really big hopes for Trash Force and Falling Thingies. The latter may surprise everyone, including myself!
