## Introduction

During the [Ludum Dare 58](https://ldjam.com/) game jam, we created **Greg gathers ghosts because that's what he loves the most**. The theme was **Collector**, and we had 3 days complete the game. The team consisted of Myself (Viktor), Manisha, Keely and Axel. 

This is the same team responsible for bringing you the infamous [RAMpage](https://bluepinstudio.itch.io/rampage) and [Antz vs Plantz](https://bluepinstudio.itch.io/antz-vs-plantz). With an added bonus of Mr. Axel! Long time orbiter, first time collaborator.

## What Went Well



<span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0de076ff, #30deebff); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;">**Comment from Axel (Art)**:</span> I don't often personally work in teams, so having clear division of labor was nice. Being able to safely rely on other people to focus on the design, music, and programming allowed more focus on the art side which was needed.

<span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0de076ff, #30deebff); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;">**Comment from Keely (Greg)**:</span> Aesthetic, music and vibe of the game turned out great. I liked the initial ideation - the base mechanics of the game felt like a neat spin on bullet hell that I hadn't seen before.

<span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0de076ff, #30deebff); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;">**Comment from Manisha (Music)**:</span> I’m starting to get a better feel for the kind of sound I want after seeing the art and asking about the gameplay pacing to get an idea about the tempo. From there, I’ve been getting good at laying down a solid foundation to build on. I also feel like my workflow is improving, I’m getting faster at testing out ideas and knowing what fits or doesn’t fit the vibe. I’m also starting to trust my ear more instead of second-guessing every choice.


## Challenges

 

<span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0de076ff, #30deebff); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;">**Comment from Axel (Art)**:</span> I'm not an artist in any sense of the word, mostly do programming, so it was definitely a different track of mind. Think I'm pretty slow at it, and generally not super happy with most of the output. I also unfortunately just didn't have as much time as I would have liked to dedicate towards the jam, and am thankful for others largely supporting most the project.

<span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0de076ff, #30deebff); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;">**Comment from Keely (Greg)**:</span> I just wasn't really all that available to help with stuff. For previous jams we had a little more coordination/in person collaboration which is what I like about game jams.

<span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0de076ff, #30deebff); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;">**Comment from Manisha (Music)**:</span> I wasn’t free all weekend and had a massive headache on the last day but I pushed through! Sadly, I couldn’t find the right sounds until just a couple hours before the deadline. Luckily, my sister had some free time and jumped in to help. She actually came up with the second half of the melody line, so props to her for saving me while I was half-dead. After that, I cleaned things up, added a spooky ambience in the background and called it a wrap. It ended up being a bit more chaotic than I’d like, and I really wanted to stream the process, but overall I’m happy with how it turned out. I also didn’t really contribute to the gameplay or brainstorming side of things, so I had a bit of FOMO and didn't feel the team aspect as much as usual, which was totally my choice but I hope no one minded! The team handled that part super well and it all came together nicely in the end.



## The Final Product



<span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0de076ff, #30deebff); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;">**Comment from Axel (Art)**:</span> It was really interesting seeing other peoples design ideas, and I think it added a lot of flavor to something that if I had made myself would be quite stale. I think the rest of the team did a really great job, and although I'm not super happy with my art in general, think the overall product is pretty fun!

<span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0de076ff, #30deebff); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;">**Comment from Keely (Greg)**:</span> It was a good scope. There's some neat ideas in there. Some aspects could use some nudging in terms of the challenge/feedback but overall it turned out pretty well. Also, Greg is cool. I'm glad I got the chance to help bring him and his ghost fetish into the world.

<span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0de076ff, #30deebff); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;">**Comment from Manisha (Music)**:</span> Pretty happy! It’s upbeat and fits the gameplay well, though it could’ve been less repetitive. That’s something I’ll work on next time. Still, seeing the positive feedback has made it all worth it!


## Reception

**Final Game**: After two weeks of people playing the game we got our scores! We had 47 people leave ratings, and lots of comments as well. Here's a link to the scores and feedback! <https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/58/greg-gathers-ghosts-because-thats-what-he-loves-the-most>.
