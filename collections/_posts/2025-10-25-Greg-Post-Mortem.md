## Introduction

During the [Ludum Dare 58](https://ldjam.com/) game jam, we created **Greg gathers ghosts because that's what he loves the most**. The theme was **Collector**, and we had 3 days complete the game. The team consisted of Myself (Viktor), Manisha and Keely. This is the same team responsible for bringing you the infamous [RAMpage](https://bluepinstudio.itch.io/rampage) and [Antz vs Plantz](https://bluepinstudio.itch.io/antz-vs-plantz). With an added bonus of Mr. Axel! Long time orbiter, first time collaborator.

## What Went Well



<span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0de076ff, #30deebff); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;">**Comment from Axel (Art)**:</span> I don't often personally work in teams, so having clear division of labor was nice. Being able to safely rely on other people to focus on the design, music, and programming allowed more focus on the art side which was needed.

<span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0de076ff, #30deebff); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;">**Comment from Keely (Greg)**:</span> Aesthetic, music and vibe of the game turned out great. I liked the initial ideation - the base mechanics of the game felt like a neat spin on bullet hell that I hadn't seen before.

## Challenges

 

<span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0de076ff, #30deebff); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;">**Comment from Axel (Art)**:</span> I'm not an artist in any sense of the word, mostly do programming, so it was definitely a different track of mind. Think I'm pretty slow at it, and generally not super happy with most of the output. I also unfortunately just didn't have as much time as I would have liked to dedicate towards the jam, and am thankful for others largely supporting most the project.

<span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0de076ff, #30deebff); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;">**Comment from Keely (Greg)**:</span> I just wasn't really all that available to help with stuff. For previous jams we had a little more coordination/in person collaboration which is what I like about game jams.

## The Final Product



<span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0de076ff, #30deebff); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;">**Comment from Axel (Art)**:</span> It was really interesting seeing other peoples design ideas, and I think it added a lot of flavor to something that if I had made myself would be quite stale. I think the rest of the team did a really great job, and although I'm not super happy with my art in general, think the overall product is pretty fun!

<span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0de076ff, #30deebff); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent;">**Comment from Keely (Greg)**:</span> It was a good scope. There's some neat ideas in there. Some aspects could use some nudging in terms of the challenge/feedback but overall it turned out pretty well. Also, Greg is cool. I'm glad I got the chance to help bring him and his ghost fetish into the world.
