## Introduction

During the [Ludum Dare 58](https://ldjam.com/) game jam, we created **Greg gathers ghosts because that's what he loves the most**. The theme was **Collector**, and we had 3 days complete the game. The team consisted of Myself (Viktor), Manisha and Keely. This is the same team responsible for bringing you the infamous [RAMpage](https://bluepinstudio.itch.io/rampage). Keely and Manisha are both gamedevs who live in Toronto, Canada area. 

This allows us to meet up in person to collaborate which is a treat! All three of us are working on our own Steam games (links below) so this was a perfect opportunity to distract ourselves and inject some fresh air into what can sometimes be a very long process.

## What Went Well

We managed to get prototypes of all the mini-games up and running on day 2 which allowed all of us to base all future work on those. This was super valuable to me because I could being iterating on things like menus and particles without worrying about the gameplay being incomplete. The fruits of that labor can be seen in the final product which is my first game jam entry that has achievements!

Also, I should mention that this is the first time trying to implement 3D assets in one of my games. Of course we had to 'fake' it by using rasterized 3D models as pngs but I think it was still wildly successful!

## Challenges

The main challenges for me was optimizing the game as much as possible. At its largest it was 120MB, and this was before all the assets were in. Turns out exporting hundreds of 1080p frames of an animation takes up a ton of space. We made a lot of progress there, I think we ended up shipping the game at 110MB (whereas it would've been near 150MB).

## The Final Product

Ship Happens ended up becoming one of my favorite game jam submissions to-date. The team was wholesome and very hard working and creative. The game is full of fun art, sounds and mini-games. I'm writing this before I know the final scores and outcome as far as reception but if you asked me, we smashed it out of the park! I recommend everyone reading this to give it a try :)

## Reception

**Final Game**: After a week of people playing the game we got our scores! We had 23 people leave ratings, and lots of comments as well. Here's a link to the scores and feedback! <https://itch.io/jam/do-you-wanna-jam-2025/rate/3799754>. The scores we got are fantastic! Hopefully when we deploy the game to Newgrounds with some fixes people like it just as much :)
