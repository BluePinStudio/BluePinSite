## Welcome!

Woweee! November was a bit of a whirlwind. I was tasked (by past-me) to chill out. But I didn't really chill at all. So much stuff done! Let's dive in...

## November 2025 Goals

- [ ] One long-form YouTube videos (November 24th?)
- [x] Pixel Fixel update
- [x] Charles the Bee Multiplayer Update
- [x] Visit 2 in-person gamedev meetups (Bonus Stage & Dirty Rectangles in Toronto)
- [x] Submit a game to [Alakajam 22](https://alakajam.com/)
- [x] Write a [post-mortem blog post](/blog/2025-11-23-Yield-Post-Mortem/) for Alakajam submission
- [ ] Take it easy pal, relaaaax

Welp! We did it! Almost. 

The youtube video goal has been quite elusive. Will I finally have one ready in December? Only time will tell. I have moved it for a December 2025 goal. The other list items were accomplished quite nicely and have corresponding blogs on the website or posts in the discord.


## Bonus Tasks Completed in November 2025

- [x] Visit the [Toronto Game Expo](https://www.torontogameexpo.ca/)
- [x] 42hrs of [Twitch Streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/bluepinstudio)
- [x] Released a suite of gamedev tools (beta) [test em out here, at your own risk!](/tools/)
- [x] Blue Pin Studio x EvanMMO x Bonejacq x Manishagamedev Minecraft server!
- [x] 1hr interview on IGA twitch stream for Charles the Bee

Out of the bonus tasks. Two are the most exciting ones. I made a series of tools you can find in the tool section of this website. They are all pretty game-dev centric, but I aim to expand them and add more to the tool belt. A lot of it is self serving like making a tool to help me find similar games for pre-production research, or tools to help me find random factoids like "90% of steam games make less than $100k" etc.

The other exciting task completed was setting up a public minecraft server! A bunch of my gamedev friends got together and made a minecraft server that we can all use for all our communities. It's tough keeping a minecraft server populated using only one small community. Hopefully since we've combined 4 small communities it would be much more lively :) If that sounds like something you would enjoy, don't hesitate to reach out for an invite. At the moment it's invite-only to keep away the spooky bad actors.

## December 2025 Goals

- [ ] Eggnog Incorporated Overhaul Update (due by Dec 17)
- [ ] Falling Thingies incremental slight pivot
- [ ] Prepare "5 years ago I made this game" video for publishing Jan 1
- [ ] Take it easy pal, relaaaax

This time we're actually taking it easy! Last month I was crunching to finish those updates and get started on the Eggnog update. This month, half way through we'll deploy the eggnog update and the rest of the month will be relaxing. Finally! Some respite :)

I'm sure I'll have a bunch of bonus tasks that I'll report on...


## Musings
The tail end of November has been pretty stressful because of the looming dead of the eggnog update. I got a lot done on the day job front and went to a lot of gamedev events. It was a professionally enriching month in every way! Updating pixel fixel and charles the bee have been eating away at the back of my mind for a long time. Just like the eggnog update. Let's get that behind us and onto greater things in 2026!

I know you've probably heard this song a million times if you doom scroll on instagram or tiktok or youtube, but I would be remiss if I didn't include it. It's a certified banger fleeky yeet 6 7.
