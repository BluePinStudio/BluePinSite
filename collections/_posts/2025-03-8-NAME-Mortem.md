## Introduction

During the [Bigmode Game Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/bigmode-game-jam-2025) game jam, we created **Power of Loveball**. The theme was **Power**, and we had 9 days complete the game. The team consisted of Myself (Viktor), Pijinguy, Fasla and Princess Sylvysprit.

## What Went Well
All things considered; starting the programming 2 days late, making two separate game modes, starting the music 5 days late, we managed to deliver a game that I doubt many other teams could surpass given the same constraints. All elements of the game are above mediocre quality and pretty cohesive. There are lots of little quality of life stuff in the game design such as text effects for the visual novel, a fancy title screen with reactive character, sound options, player anonymous telemetry and more. Many devs don't end up having time to add little stuff like that...

## Challenges
Without going into too much detail, the challenges I had was working with our musician Sylvysprit. Her music was fantastic but I think our personalities or mannerisms got in the way of a cohesive and effortless collaboration. Combining that with the stress of putting in so many hours, having to do multiple roles (programming and sfx), joining late, and a huge scope, is what made this the most stressful game jam I've ever done. We even had a debacle about timestamps. The music Sylvysprit provided did not loop if you play the music normally, she instructed us to find at which EXACT millisecond timestamp the song could be looped at and for me to program the loop points from there. I thought that was strange for me to go digging through the audio file looking for timestamps, luckily Pijin came to the rescue. He went searching for the timestamps while I programmed the loop point functionality.


## The Final Product
Like I mentioned earlier, all things considering the game is good. At some point in the development process I asked Pijin, as the designer, if we could remove either the visual novel or platformer section so we could dedicate more time towards the remaining game mode. He declined, and arguably probably ended up giving us a higher overall score due to the "originality" of mixing two games like this. It's not the first time i merged two different game modes, but it may be the last! 



## Reception

**Final Game**: We had 208 people try it out and leave lots of comments as well. If you average the score we got in each category, you end up with a ranking of 150th. That puts us in the top 18% out of 834 games. Unfortunately we didn't end up getting any awards or a feature on Dunkey's stream. The competition was tough! So many great games. This game scores 8th out of all the ranked game jams i've done, which is a decent outcome. Due to the aforementioned player telemetry, we were also able to gather anonymous statistics about how players play the game. We found that roughly 50% of people who complete Level 1 end up completing the game. I would say thats a big win too!
