## Welcome!
Hi there. Hello there. Greetings. Let's have a peak at what the frick I've been up to in August 2025. 

First thing is first, I got this incredible offer that is apparently related to my experience in game dev. 3 steam games and 21 game jam entries make me a perfect candidate for a minimum wage part time role washing dishes in a bowling alley! How uplifting, thanks Linkedin...

## Musings
Lately I've been talking with a lot of compassionate people telling me perhaps I need to pivot to spending less time on games and more time on a safe career. I love that they care and considering their advice has filled a lot of my thoughts. I'm not sure if I'll pump the breaks. Maybe. In the mean time I came across a poem I loved so I thought I would share it with y'all. As always thanks for reading and thank you for all the support!
> *Hold fast to dreams*<br>
> *For if dreams die*<br>
> *Life is a broken-winged bird*<br>
> *That cannot fly.*<br>

Oh and here's the customary new bop I've been listening to!
