## Welcome!
Hi there. Hello there. Greetings. Let's have a peak at what the frick I've been up to in August 2025!


## August 2025 Goals 
  - [x] Participate in [Do You Wanna Jam?!](https://itch.io/jam/do-you-wanna-jam-2025) check out the [post mortem here!](/blog/2025-08-25-Ship-Happens-Post-Mortem/)
  - [ ] Land a publisher for Trash Force
  - [x] Renew passport
  - [ ] Charles anniversary update
  - [x] Prepare Falling Thingies for Launch! (all games are done and ready, progression system, achievements, twitch integration, etc)
  - [x] Put Pixel Fixel in one online showcase

It was a really busy month for my day job and side gigs so a few things fell behind. Most importantly I missed the exact one year anniversary of Charles the Bee. I will aim to have it out in September instead! Better late than never :)

## Bonus Tasks Completed in August 2025
  - [x] Go to gamedev picnic event in-person
  - [x] Release Ship Happens on Newgrounds
  - [x] Showcase Falling Thingies at 2 online meetups
  - [x] Create productivity app for internal usage

One silver lining from my attempts at finishing Charles update on time is that I created my own version of Jira. Its a super simple tech-tree ticket system that visualizes dependancies and allows me to better represent what I have brewing in my mind!

## September 2025 Goals 
  - [ ] Publish one longform youtube video 
  - [ ] Polish Falling Thingies 
  - [ ] New Trash Force Content (Boss and Act2)
  - [ ] Charles Anniversary update

Falling Thingies is still not as highly polished and interesting as I want it to be before launch. One more month of cooking on that is all I need i reckon! That means release will happen early October 2025! Very exciting. 

On top of that we're going to see the first long form video content idea I had. What I'm going to do is play and comment on a game I made 5 years ago. It will be an on-going series. Hopefully we can do at least four of those per years. I have a big backlog of games to go through!

## Musings
On the personal side August has been really tough. Been going through a lot of heartache. However on the professional side, I have some new leads that may prove to be really promising and exciting, but it will take time to nurture that. In the meantime we carry on with what we started earlier in the year and keep getting stronger overall!

Here's another fantastic song, as is customary at the end of the blog posts. See y'all in a month!
