It may be near when it seems so far

## Welcome!
Hi there cowpoke! Little side celebration for me this time around because it has been exactly 12 months un-interrupted of doing these monthly updates. Pretty cool! Anywho, lets get down to business (ðŸŽ¶to defeat the hunsðŸŽ¶)


## July 2025 Goals 
  - [x] Lay the ground work for a Falling Thingies launch which includes a serviceable version of all 6 game modes. Prepare for a month of refining and player feedback. The idea is to launch the game September 1st.
  - [x] Complete Trash Force 2.0 (hub, scalable difficulty, new boss, new enemy type, etc)
  - [ ] Land a publisher for Trash Force
  - [ ] Renew passport
  - [x] Go to 2 in-person meetups
  - [x] Present at 2 online/in-person meetups

Of course the publisher thing is an on-going challenge so it was merely hopeful to put that as a monthly goal. Why not transfer it to August's goals anyway! Helps me keep track of what I need to be focused on. Regarding the passport? Boy oh boy. The local passport office is only open until 4 and coordinating time to get the photos taken and get all the forms down there have been tricky in my business schedule. August for sure! :)


## Bonus Tasks Completed in July 2025
  - [x] Calvin, the musician for Falling Thingies, exhibited the game at GDX2025 in Alberta! Got a cool shoutout and tons of useful feedback from players. And wishlists of course.
  - [x] Updated the website in a lot of places. There's a 404 page, sitemap, announcement bar, and lots of other bits and bobs

## August 2025 Goals 
  - [ ] Participate in [Do You Wanna Jam?!](https://itch.io/jam/do-you-wanna-jam-2025)
  - [ ] Land a publisher for Trash Force
  - [ ] Renew passport
  - [ ] Charles anniversary update
  - [ ] Prepare Falling Thingies for Launch! (all games are done and ready, progression system, achievements, twitch integration, etc)
  - [ ] Put Pixel Fixel in one online showcase

That's two big ones! Charles the Bee is turning 1 year old so we have to give it some love! I can't say for sure what will be in the update but we'll try to cram as much new stuff as possible. Likewise for Falling Thingies, have to ensure that the launch works out great!



## Musings
Other than thinking about August 2025, I've been thinking about other recurring content I can make outside of these games. What I've landed on is a series where I look at games I made 5~ years ago and discuss their story and discuss how I've grown since then. I haven't come up with what the video will be called, probably something click bait. "5 years since X game" or "May 2020 -> May 2025" or something like that. Still contemplating that.

Here's a banger song, until next time folks. Thanks for reading the blog, much love!
