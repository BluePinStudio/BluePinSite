## Welcome!
Welcome back my love. I assume you're an amazing person because you're reading these! Thanks for your support, it means a lot!


## July 2025 Goals 
  - [ ] Lay the ground work for a Falling Thingies launch which includes a serviceable version of all 6 game modes. Prepare for a month of refining and player feedback. The idea is to launch the game September 1st.
  - [ ] Complete Trash Force 2.0 (hub, scalable difficulty, new boss, new enemy type, etc)
  - [ ] Land a publisher for Trash Force
  - [x] Renew passport
  - [x] Go to 2 in-person meetups
  - [x] Present at 2 online/in-person meetups

Absolutely smashed last months goals! Here's a link to the aforementioned [Trash Force steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3794650/Trash_Force/) in case you wanted to wishlist it, but you'll be hearing a lot more about that game as we get closer and closer to finishing it :)

## Footer & Note to Future Self
A hectic month because it involved being sick for a solid week, then falling behind on my work stuff. It all got sorted out eventually and we're back to firing on all cylinders! ðŸ’› At some point I had the wind knocked out of my sails in regards to the lack of success after 63 months of trying, but I think we're closer than ever so I'm not too stuck on that.
