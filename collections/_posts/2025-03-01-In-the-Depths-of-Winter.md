- [Alakajam 21 Post Mortem](/blog/2025-03-15-Falling-Thingies-Post-Mortem/)

I'm also busy deploying the Pixel Fixel anniversary update! A little bit late because I got sick for a solid week, but we're going! Feb goals ended up basiiiiiically complete!

## Bonus Tasks Completed in February 2025
  - [x] Hosted the 8th Pixel Fixel Tournament
  - [x] Pitched Trash Force to 30 more publishers

  Besides the regular goals. I managed to do another successsful Pixel Fixel tournament and pitch more publishers for Trash Force! Here is the list of publishers who have responded in red if they said no and yellow if they said maybe. Its tough going out there!

## March 2025 Goals 
  - [ ] Go to two game dev meetups, Bonus Stage Toronto and Dirty Rectangles Toronto
  - [ ] Get Explory Story to a state where it's playable from start to finish including cutscenes.
  - [ ] Put up 50 more Pixel Fixel stickers!
  - [ ] Make a special video for the 5 year Blue Pin Studio Anniversary! (March 29th)

I slacked a bit on the Explory Story side, but I will pick up the slack and finish Feb's goal in March! The rest of the month should be pretty straight forward. Just working on all my main projects and keeping my head down. No jams!

 

## Musings
The troubles don't stop coming but neither do we. Lol that is probably not the best way to phrase that... Things are looking up. People were really pleased with my jam entries and my bigger projects are coming along. It seems like its all going to culminate to something this year, but if not, theres another year after that! Onwards!

Shoutout to all the Habibis!
